# seminarjson
this was an application i designed and developed for the zoho seminar webpage, as a part of my internship. my contribution was incorporated into the company's website. I was asked to develop a webpage that listed out the seminars from the chosen date, and in a dropdown format. the challenge was to use a combination of SQL and NoSQL.
